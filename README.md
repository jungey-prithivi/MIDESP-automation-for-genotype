# Identifying significant SNP for genomic prediction pre-filtering

MIDESP was used for identifying SNPs closely associated with the phenotype. Then top 1% SNPs were used in genomic prediction to see if there is any improvement in prediction  accuracy. The inputs are shared in Genomic-Prediction-ANN repository.
