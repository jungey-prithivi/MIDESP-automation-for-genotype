Identifying significant SNP for genomic prediction pre-filtering
[200~MIDESP was used for identifying SNPs closely associated with the phenotype. Then top 1% SNPs were used in genomic prediction to see if there is any improvement in prediction accuracy. The inputs are shared in Genomic-Prediction-ANN repository. more detail of MIDESP can be found here: https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/10/9/921
